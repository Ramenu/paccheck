A very simple tool to check the latest Arch Linux news. Can be useful if you're upgrading packages and there's an important announcement that requires manual intervention. 
Paccheck is designed to be ergonomic and extensible, it does not invoke Pacman or any other program for that matter. All it does it alert you of any new notifications.
